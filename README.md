# CGS LDA Multicore Parallelization
This is a framework for experiments with multicore parallelization of collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm on topic models such as LDA and Bag of Timestamps models.

Together with this framework, we have built a dataset for experiments of time-aware topic modeling, especially Bag of Timestamps model (at branch CGS_LDA_Multicore_BoT). The dataset contains over 1,000,000 scientific publications in the computer science domain from 1951 to 2010, crawled from http://academic.research.microsoft.com. The dataset is ready to be used with this framework. 
<br/>The dataset can be downloaded at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8gXe63FdGk5ZjQzTVloZlVPZU0
